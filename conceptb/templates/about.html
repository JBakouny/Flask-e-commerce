        <span class="name">Concept B</span> is a family business that takes care of bees and produces all natural products that come from this amazing insect. &#128029;
        <br>
        We also welcome families, students and anyone who is interested in learning more about nature and this wonderful insect in our bee farms in Dlebta, Kfardebian, Bikfaya, and Tannourine.
        <br><br>
        During these difficult times, we left Greece and came to Lebanon to start here, hoping and believing that this country would rise up again. <br>
        Concept B is your choice of <span class="highlight">100% natural</span> products just as nature and bees produce them.
